### 1️⃣ Build C++

There are 3 options to compile and run C++ file(s)

- Using command line
- Using Makefile
- **Using CMake**

Maybe there's another options, but all I know for now are those 3 options.

1. **CMake**

   To build C++ file using CMake, create a `CMakeLists.txt` inside the top level of the directory.
   After that run

   ```cmake
   cmake [options] -S <path-to-source> -B <path-to-build>
   ```

   ```cmake
   cmake -S . -B build
   ```

   run cmake based on configuration file located inside **.** (current directory) and placed the result inside **build**
   directory

   or sometime people used to use this kind of setup

   Create a directory called **build** and `cd` into it

   ```shell
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   Run `cmake`. **..** means, run cmake with source file (CMakeLists.txt) is located in previous directory and placed
   the
   result inside this directory

   ```cmake
   cmake ..
   ```

2. **CMake Syntax**

   The hard part are the **cmake syntax** and **connect multiple C++ files**
   [CMake CheatSheet](https://usercontent.one/wp/cheatsheet.czutro.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CMake_Cheatsheet.pdf)

   **Must** have configurations in **CMakeLists.txt** file:
    - `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)`
    - `project(project_name)`
    - `add_executable(project_name, list_of_cpp_source_file)`
    - `target_include_directories(project_name visibility list_of_directory)`: use this so that we can use **#include <
      directory_name>** instead of normal double quotes
    - `target_link_directories(project_name visibility list_of_directory)`
    - `target_link_libraries(project_name, list_of_library)`
    - `add_library(library_name list_of_cpp_file)`: use this inside the sub folder to make this sub folder as a library
      so that the parent cmake can connect it

3. **CMake Levels**

   What happen if we want to link our executables that placed in a different folder/sub folder? Basically, we need to **
   create a CMakeLists.txt** inside that sub folder.

   **In root CMakeLists.txt** add this:
    - `add_subdirectory()`
    - `target_include_directories()`
    - `target_link_directories()`
    - `target_link_libraries()`

   **In the sub folder CMakeLists.txt** add this:
    - `add_library()`

### 2️⃣ Basic C++

### 3️⃣ Object Oriented C++

### 4️⃣ Testing C++

### 5️⃣ Modern C++

1. **Map**

   In modern C++ (C++11), we can define and access elements inside map using different signature as follows:
    - **Define**
       ```c++
       map<string, string> person { { "name", "johny depp"}, { "born", "1919" } };
       ```
    - **Access**
       ```c++
       cout << my_map.at("name");
       ```
      will result
       ```shell
       "johny depp"
       ```
